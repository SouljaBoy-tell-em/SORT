For you, queens of my soul, my treasured
Young beauties, for your sake did I

To writing down, I’ll not deny,
With faithful hand of long past ages

For which I ask no praise…. But stay!
For my reward-I need not seek it-
Is hope: Oh, that some girl should scan,
As only one who’s lovesick can,
These naughty songs of mine in secret!

A princess sits locked in a cell,
And Grey Wolf serves her very well;
There, in a mortar, onward sweeping

The wicked Baba-Yaga flies;
There pines Koshchei and lusts for gol
